Things to have in mind while migrating to this new version of the system :

- ! and @ notations in sc files (for warning and end). Need to be adapted to the new metadata structure : @end, @warning, @guitarCapo, ...

- Remove all the +++ from the lyrics (99% sure that's not that important)

- refactor with section pattern modificators

- livenotes book data : renamed "measures" by "pattern". Simplified measures (not always 4 values). Renamed "[" "]3" ":".
