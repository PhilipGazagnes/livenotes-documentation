## Menu

The menu is accessible from any page in the top right corner.

It contains :

- Song
    - Adjust tone

- Global
    - Visualisation mode : choose the visualisation mode (Structure & Chords only, Info & Lyrics only, Both). This choice is applied generally, so if you close a song and open another one, it will open in the visualisation mode you chose here.
    - Show information form musicians : if not checked, this will mask technical information for musicians. This is useful when the app is used by the audience.
    - Dark mode
    - default lyrics size 
    - Screen saver
